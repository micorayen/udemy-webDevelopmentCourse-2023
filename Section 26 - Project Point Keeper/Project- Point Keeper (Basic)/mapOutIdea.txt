Points
- change points, select and manipulate using JS
- add IDs to points to distinct it.
Buttons
- add 3 buttons p1, p2, & reset - put idon it

JS
-  add script to mockUp - test it outright

Logic
- when clikc  p1 - add 1 pts to player 1 , do sameon p2
- when clicked reset - reset points to 0 and reset to default color(pts)
- stop pts increment when it hits winning score (apply on both players)
- when a player hits winning score - disabled p1 & p2 buttons
