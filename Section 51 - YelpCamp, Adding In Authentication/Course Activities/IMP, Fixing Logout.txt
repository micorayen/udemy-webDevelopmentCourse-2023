IMPORTANT: Fixing Logout
Read below if you get this error:
req#logout requires a callback function
When you do the upcoming 'Adding Logout' video lecture for the YelpCamp app project, please be aware that Passport.js was updated since the recording of that lecture. As a result, some of the code needs to be adjusted, so be sure to keep this lecture note handy while following the next video.

Namely, when you implement the req.logout() logic in the /logout route (in routes/users.js) in the upcoming video lecture, you might see this error when you test out the logout functionality: req#logout requires a callback function

This happens because in the latest versions of Passport.js, the req.logout() method now requires a callback function passed as an argument. Inside this callback function, we will handle any potential errors and also execute the code to set a flash message and redirect the user.

Therefore, make sure to update your /logout route in the routes/users.js code so it looks like this:

router.get('/logout', (req, res, next) => {
    req.logout(function (err) {
        if (err) {
            return next(err);
        }
        req.flash('success', 'Goodbye!');
        res.redirect('/campgrounds');
    });
}); 
After you make this modification, it should work correctly!
