Note: Solving an upcoming code issue with mongoose version 7
Important note regarding the upcoming video lecture!
Be sure to fully watch the next video lecture to find out and understand which code we are referring to in this note.

The potential error that you might get with the newest mongoose version 7 while writing the code in the next video: TypeError: Invalid schema configuration: `false` is not a valid type at path `id`.

SOLUTION:

In that next video lecture, toward the last part of the video, in the models/user.js code, we will be implementing the following line of code in the addresses array inside of a mongoose schema named userSchema:

      _id: {id: false},
If adding this line makes your app show the error message mentioned above, you might be using the newest mongoose 7 module versions.

To solve it, modify the mentioned line by adding an underscore _ before the id in the { _id: false } syntax on that line. So, that line should now look like this:

      _id: {_id: false},
That should solve any mongoose version 7 errors related to it.

ANOTHER SOLUTION:

To avoid compatibility issues with this and to be able to use Colt's exact code from the upcoming video lecture, you can install a mongoose version lower than 7.0.0 by using the following npm command, and then that error shouldn't happen:

npm install mongoose@"<7.0.0"

(be sure to type or copy-paste this command exactly as shown above)
